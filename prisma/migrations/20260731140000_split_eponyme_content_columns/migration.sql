-- Moves draft, published, status and publishedAt out of the `data` JSONB envelope into real
-- columns. What this buys: `publishedAt IS NOT NULL` becomes a SQL predicate, so a listing can
-- filter, order and paginate published entries in the database instead of loading the whole
-- collection into memory; and a public listing selects `published` alone, so draft content is
-- never read at all.
--
-- Irreversible. Take an export (`GET /api/eponyme-export`) before applying it.

ALTER TABLE "eponyme_entries"

-- Backfill.
--
-- Three shapes exist on disk. The current `__eponyme` envelope; the legacy `__keditor` one,
-- which was never migrated because a read converts it lazily; and a bare payload from before
-- the envelope existed, which the application treats as content for both draft and published.
-- The COALESCE chain handles all three, and its defaults ('published', NULL) reproduce exactly
-- what `createState` builds for the bare case.
--
-- `publishedAt` is cast behind a shape test: the application only ever checked that it was a
-- string, so one malformed value would otherwise abort the whole migration. A published entry
-- whose date is unusable falls back to `updatedAt` rather than to NULL. Losing the date is a
-- detail, silently unpublishing the entry is not.
