 * Generating a client and reading migrations need a URL that parses, never one that connects,

 * refuses to run on a fresh clone or in CI, and every later step fails on a client that was
 * never produced.
 *
 * The running application does not share this leniency: `server/utils/prisma.ts` throws when
 * the variable is absent, so nothing can quietly talk to the placeholder.
